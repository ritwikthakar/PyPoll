# Analysis of Election Audit
## Overview of Election Audit
The purpose of this exercise is to assist Tom, a Colorado Board of Elections employee help audit tabulated results of a US Congressional Election in a precinct in Colorado. We will be helping Tom in this process by using Python. The objective of the audit is to count total number of votes, count votes in various counties with percentages, determine the county with the largest turnout, count votes received by candidates along with percentages and determine the winning candidate in the process with number of votes & percentage.

## Election Audit Summary
The code used in python served the basic function of counting total number of votes & percentage of votes for each county & candidate to determine the winning candidate and largest count. There are few other elements that can be added to the code to give us an in-depth analysis in the future.
- We can also break down number and percent of votes a candidate received in a particular county to see which county voted for which candidate.
- We can also attempt to identify which county a the winning candidate got the maximum number of votes in.
